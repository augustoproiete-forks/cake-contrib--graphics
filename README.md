If you would like to use any of the Cake Contrib icons within your NuGet packages, or anywhere else, the recommended URL's are as follows:

- **Addin**
  - https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cake-contrib/graphics/png/addin/cake-contrib-addin-medium.png
- **Module**
  - https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cake-contrib/graphics/png/module/cake-contrib-module-medium.png
- **Recipe**
  - https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cake-contrib/graphics/png/recipe/cake-contrib-recipe-medium.png
- **Frosting Recipe**
  - https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cake-contrib/graphics/png/frosting-recipe/cake-contrib-frosting-recipe-medium.png
- **Community**
  - https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cake-contrib/graphics/png/community/cake-contrib-community-medium.png

These use the GitHub CDN, and are therefore better than using a direct URL similar to:

- **Addin**
  - https://github.com/cake-contrib/graphics/blob/master/png/addin/cake-contrib-addin-medium.png
- **Module**
  - https://github.com/cake-contrib/graphics/blob/master/png/module/cake-contrib-module-medium.png
- **Recipe**
  - https://github.com/cake-contrib/graphics/blob/master/png/recipe/cake-contrib-recipe-medium.png
- **Frosting Recipe**
  - https://github.com/cake-contrib/graphics/blob/master/png/frosting-recipe/cake-contrib-frosting-recipe-medium.png
- **Community**
  - https://github.com/cake-contrib/graphics/blob/master/png/community/cake-contrib-community-medium.png
